# portfoliotracker
Cryptocurrency portfoliotracker that tracks your cryptocurrency balances in real time. The only thing you have to do is paste your public wallet addresses from all the different cryptocurrencies you hold. The script grabs the current prices from an API and checks to balances on the wallets with a block explorer. After this the script multiplies both numbers and displays your dollar value per currency. It will also add all the different currencies to get a total value of your portfolio. No need for manually adding your balances only for privacycoins.

This project is currently in it's idea phase so if you like to help out, you can do so! :)
